# Stock Market Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to build familiarity with VBA by writing a program that could effectively analyze a large set of stock market data in a reasonable amount of time.

## Results
### Market Analysis
While the returns for almost every stock were astronomical in 2017, only two holdings saw positive returns the following year - ENPH and RUN. There could be a number of reasons for such decline, but the resilience of ENPH and RUN should be noted. 

RUN's improvement from 2017 to 2018 is also worth noting, as while all other companies struggled to provide returns to their shareholders, RUN saw even greater success, with returns skyrocketing from a meager 5.5% in 2017 to 84.0% in 2018. Perhaps this signals an advantage RUN has in the current market, which may make it the best choice of the 11. And while ENPH was technically able to withstand a changing market - still providing positive returns for investors - it did see a substantial decline from 2017 to 2018, which could mean it will not remain viable in the future.

### Execution Time
The program runs in a somewhat reasonable amount of time. With execution times somewhere between 2.6 and 3.3 seconds (depending on machine, other programs, etc.).
