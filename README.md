# Stock Market Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to build familiarity with VBA by writing a program that could effectively analyze a large set of stock market data in a reasonable amount of time.

## Results
### Market Analysis
While the returns for almost every stock were astronomical in 2017, only two holdings saw positive returns the following year - ENPH and RUN. There could be a number of reasons for such decline, but the resilience of ENPH and RUN should be noted. 

RUN's improvement from 2017 to 2018 is also worth noting, as while all other companies struggled to provide returns to their shareholders, RUN saw even greater success, with returns skyrocketing from a meager 5.5% in 2017 to 84.0% in 2018. Perhaps this signals an advantage RUN has in the current market, which may make it the best choice of the eleven. And while ENPH was technically able to withstand a changing market - still providing positive returns for investors - it did see a substantial decline from 2017 (129.5% ROI) to 2018 (81.9% ROI), which could mean it will not remain viable in the future.

### Execution Time
The program runs in a somewhat reasonable amount of time, with execution times typically between 2.6 and 3.3 seconds (depending on machine, other running programs, etc.).

## Summary
Conducting this analysis shed light on the pros and cons of refactoring code. While it gives the programmer a headstart as opposed to starting from scratch, such a lead can be lost fairly quickly if the programmer is forced to sift through hundreds of lines of code deciphering functionality, correcting errors, or even erasing and rewriting large chunks of the program. That said, it is a perfectly acceptable practice as long as it is well thought out and used within reason. This assignment is a great example, as the foundation for the program had already been constructed and it worked seamlessly with the new code, so no time was wasted rewriting code that already been written and the programmer could get right into the nitty gritty - figuring out how to implement the intended functionality.
